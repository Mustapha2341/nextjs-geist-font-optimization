# Detailed Implementation Plan for Hotel Booking Platform

This plan describes the step-by-step process to create a responsive, Booking.com-like website complete with search functionality, property listings, detailed hotel views, and a multi-step booking process. The design uses a modern blue and white color palette, clean typography, and responsive layout techniques.

## 1. File and Directory Modifications

**New Files to Create:**
- **`/src/app/page.tsx`** – The Home (Landing) Page integrating the Header, Hero, SearchBar, FilterSidebar, and hotel listings.
- **`/src/app/hotel/[id]/page.tsx`** – Dynamic Property Detail Page to show an individual hotel’s images, description, amenities, map (placeholder), and booking form.
- **`/src/app/booking/[id]/page.tsx`** – Booking Process Page implementing a multi-step form for guest information, payment details, and reservation preferences.
- **`/src/app/booking/confirmation/page.tsx`** – Booking Confirmation Page summarizing reservation details.

**New Component Files:**
- **`/src/components/Header.tsx`** – Navigation bar with the logo, language/currency selectors, and user account options.
- **`/src/components/Hero.tsx`** – Hero section that displays a full-width travel background image (using a placeholder image) and overlay text with trust indicators/promotions.
- **`/src/components/SearchBar.tsx`** – Search form with location input, check-in/check-out date pickers, and guest/room selection.
- **`/src/components/FilterSidebar.tsx`** – Sidebar containing filters such as price range slider, star ratings checkboxes, property type, and amenities.
- **`/src/components/HotelCard.tsx`** – Card component for hotel listings showing an image, hotel name, location, rating, review count, price, and a “Book Now” button.
- **`/src/components/Footer.tsx`** – Footer with links to destinations, customer service, partner programs, and mobile/social media text links.
- **`/src/components/BookingForm.tsx`** – Multi-step booking form handling guest information and (dummy) payment details.

**Supporting File:**
- **`/src/lib/mockData.ts`** (optional) – Contains sample hotel data (name, location, rating, image URL, price) to simulate real listings.

**Existing Files to Update:**
- **`/src/app/layout.tsx`** – Ensure global layout wraps all pages with the Header and Footer.
- **`/src/app/globals.css`** – Update global CSS to define color variables, responsive typography, spacing, and media queries.

## 2. Step-by-Step File Changes

### Global Styling & Layout
- **File:** `/src/app/globals.css`
  - Define CSS variables for primary blue and white colors.
  - Add base styles (typography, spacing) and responsive media queries.
- **File:** `/src/app/layout.tsx`
  - Import and render `<Header />` at the top and `<Footer />` at the bottom so all pages share the same layout.
  
### Header Component
- **File:** `/src/components/Header.tsx`
  - Create a navigation bar using semantic `<nav>` with:
    - A text-based logo (e.g., "HotelBooking").
    - Currency and language selectors rendered as simple text or `<select>` elements.
    - User account links (e.g., Sign In, Register) rendered with accessible button elements.
  - Use CSS Flexbox for horizontal alignment and implement error checks for any missing props.

### Hero Section
- **File:** `/src/components/Hero.tsx`
  - Render a full-width `<img>` tag:
    - Use the URL:  
      `https://placehold.co/1920x1080?text=Travel+Destination+Background`
    - Include a detailed `alt` attribute such as “Travel destination background showcasing modern design elements and an inviting atmosphere.”
    - Add a graceful `onerror` handler to show a fallback background color or message.
  - Overlay promotional text and trust indicators (e.g., “Millions of properties”, “Verified reviews”, “24/7 support”) using positioned text blocks.

### SearchBar Component
- **File:** `/src/components/SearchBar.tsx`
  - Build a form with:
    - A location text input.
    - Two date inputs for check-in and check-out (using native `<input type="date">` controls).
    - A guest & room selection dropdown.
  - Implement onChange handlers and proper input validation; display error messages if inputs are missing or incorrect.

### Filter Sidebar Component
- **File:** `/src/components/FilterSidebar.tsx`
  - Render a sidebar with filtering options:
    - Price range slider (using `<input type="range">`).
    - Checkboxes for star ratings and property types.
    - A list for amenities and review score filters.
  - Ensure modern spacing, hover transitions, and error handling for invalid selections.

### HotelCard Component
- **File:** `/src/components/HotelCard.tsx`
  - Accept props (hotel name, location, rating, review count, price, image URL).
  - Use a placeholder for the hotel image:  
    `https://placehold.co/400x300?text=Hotel+Image+Preview`
  - Render a “Deal” badge if special offers apply and a “Book Now” button that wraps a Next.js `<Link>` for navigation.
  - Add hover effects, and include `onerror` in the `<img>` tag for fallback handling.

### Footer Component
- **File:** `/src/components/Footer.tsx`
  - Create a clean footer using a grid or flex layout.
  - Include text links for destinations, customer service, partner programs, and mobile/social media download links.
  - Keep the design minimalistic with ample spacing.

### Home Page (Landing Page)
- **File:** `/src/app/page.tsx`
  - Import and combine the following components: `<Header />`, `<Hero />`, `<SearchBar />`, `<FilterSidebar />`, and a grid layout of multiple `<HotelCard />` components.
  - Retrieve mock property data from `/src/lib/mockData.ts` to render hotel listings.
  - Implement error boundaries to capture and display component loading errors.

### Property Detail Page
- **File:** `/src/app/hotel/[id]/page.tsx`
  - Dynamically fetch and display property details based on the URL `id`.
  - Render an image gallery with multiple placeholder images, e.g.,  
    `https://placehold.co/800x600?text=Detailed+Hotel+Image+Gallery`
  - List a detailed description, amenities, and an interactive map placeholder (e.g., a static image for now).
  - Include guest reviews and embed the `<BookingForm />` component for reservations.
  - Add error handling for missing or invalid property IDs.

### Booking Process Page
- **File:** `/src/app/booking/[id]/page.tsx`
  - Implement a multi-step booking flow:
    - Step 1: Gather guest information and reservation details.
    - Step 2: Collect payment information (use dummy inputs for simulation).
  - Use `<BookingForm />` to manage the multi-step process with client-side validation and error messages.
  - Transition between steps using React state management.

### Booking Form Component
- **File:** `/src/components/BookingForm.tsx`
  - Create form sections for guest details (name, email, phone), stay details (dates), and payment details.
  - Validate each step and provide clear error messages on invalid inputs.
  - Use local component state to simulate multi-step progress and finally redirect to the confirmation page upon successful submission.

### Booking Confirmation Page
- **File:** `/src/app/booking/confirmation/page.tsx`
  - Render a confirmation message summarizing the reservation (e.g., hotel name, booking dates, reservation number).
  - Include a call-to-action to “Return to Home” using Next.js `<Link>`.
  - Ensure fallback text if booking details are absent.

## 3. Integration, Best Practices & Testing

- **Routing & Integration:**
  - Update Next.js routing via the app directory so all pages are accessible.
  - Link new components using the Next.js `<Link>` component for client-side transitions.
  - Update `next.config.ts` only if custom rewrites or image domains need configuration.

- **Error Handling & Validation:**
  - Use try-catch in asynchronous data fetches and React error boundaries where applicable.
  - Validate every form input with clear inline error messages.
  - Add `onerror` handlers for `<img>` tags to prevent broken image displays.

- **UI/UX Considerations:**
  - All UI components use modern layout techniques (Flexbox/Grid) for responsive design.
  - Maintain a minimalistic, professional look with ample white space, smooth hover transitions, and consistent typography.
  - Use placeholder images with descriptive alt texts and ensure they load correctly or degrade gracefully.

- **TypeScript & Code Quality:**
  - Define prop interfaces for each component.
  - Follow ESLint rules as per `eslint.config.mjs` and update TS configurations in `tsconfig.json` for any new components.
  - Document components with comments and update `README.md` with instructions and architectural notes.
